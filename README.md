# PoshProfile
A simple PoshProfile that has the humor of Douglas Adams built into each prompt.

## Installation
Using your editor of choice, edit the PowerShell profile. The PowerShell profile path can be found by opening powershell and running `$Profile` as a command. As a vscode user, I can type `code $Profile` and start editing. Inside the editor, add the contents of Profile.ps1 and save. When you open another a new powershell session, the changes should apply.
